There are two joystick controllers wired to the Arduino Mega 2560 board.One of them is used for the movement and the other one fot the rotation of the rectungular
This projects takes the output values from the motion of the controllers and sents the to serial port.The python programm reads this data.The python programm uses graphics from the turtle module,
and creates an objects whitch is given an rectuangullar shape.Therefore the data that are stored through the serial port are used to define the direction and the angle of motion for the shape
